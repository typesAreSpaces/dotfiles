Matching Regular Expressions with OCaml Patterns

This syntax extension turns

    match%pcre x with
    | {|re1|} -> e1
    ...
    | {|reN|} -> eN
    | _ -> e0

into suitable invocations of the ocaml-re library.  The patterns are plain
strings of the form accepted by `Re_pcre`, with the following additions:

  - `(?<var>...)` defines a group and binds whatever it matches as `var`.
    The type of `var` will be `string` if the match is guaranteed given that
    the whole pattern matches, and `string option` if the variable is bound
    to or nested below an optionally matched group.

  - `?<var>` at the start of a pattern binds group 0 as `var : string`.
    This may not be the full string if the pattern is unanchored.

A variable is allowed for the universal case and is bound to the matched
string.  A regular alias is currently not allowed for patterns, since it is
not obvious whether is should bind the full string or group 0.
