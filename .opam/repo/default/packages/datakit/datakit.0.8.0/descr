Orchestrate applications using a 9P dataflow

*DataKit* is a tool to orchestrate applications using a 9P dataflow. It
revisits the UNIX pipeline concept, with a modern twist: streams of
tree-structured data instead of raw text. DataKit allows you to define
complex build pipelines over version-controlled data, using shell
scripts interacting with the filesystem.

DataKit is currently used as the coordination
layer for [HyperKit](http://github.com/docker/hyperkit), the
hypervisor component of
[Docker for Mac and Windows](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/).
