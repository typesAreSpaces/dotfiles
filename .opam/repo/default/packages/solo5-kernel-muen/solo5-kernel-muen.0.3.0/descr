Solo5 sandboxed execution environment (muen target)

Solo5 is a sandboxed execution environment primarily intended for, but not
limited to, running applications built using various unikernels (a.k.a.
library operating systems).

This package provides the Solo5 components needed to build MirageOS unikernels
on the "muen" target. The resulting unikernels can then be deployed directly on
a host running the Muen Separation Kernel.

Building this target is supported on 64-bit Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems.
