query the opam package build status

The opam-ci tool provides an interface to the opam 2.0 continuous
integration cluster, which regularly rebuilds the package repository
across a variety of OCaml compiler versions, operating system
distributions and CPU architectures. These builds are done regularly in
remote infrastructure and the results are pushed to a metadata
repository where they are fetched by this command to give you a summary
of the status of your own packages.

The `opam ci status` command shows a dashboard of the build results
across this matrix. Packages can be filtered by maintainer substrings
or tag names in the opam package description, so you see only those
relevant to you.

The `opam ci logs` command will show you the build errors so you can fix
them. It also generates a Dockerfile of the precise build to reproduce
the environment locally for you.

To get started, try these commands with the maintainer argument
replaced with your own information or tags:

```
# show all the failing MirageOS packages
opam ci status -m org:mirage | less -R

# show all the packages maintained by anil@recoil.org
opam ci status -m anil@recoil.org --filter=all | less -R

# show all the packages failing on the latest RC of the OCaml compiler
opam ci status --filter=variants:rc | less -R

# display all failure logs for the mirage-xen package
opam ci logs mirage-xen
```

See the `--help` pages for the subcommands below for more detailed
information.
