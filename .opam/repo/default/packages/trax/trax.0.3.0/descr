Stack-independent exception tracing
Trax defines a special exception, which is used to store a trace of where the exception was raised and re-raised. This is done independently from the state of the call stack. It can be used with Lwt or other asynchronous computations in which exceptions no longer propagate simply to the calling function but may be caught, stored, and re-raised after a while and after other exceptions have occurred in unrelated computations.
