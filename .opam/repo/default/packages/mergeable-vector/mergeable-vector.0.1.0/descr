Mergeable vector based on operational transformation

mergeable-vector is vector library with support for [3-way merges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Three-way_merge) based on [operational transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation). The library also provides diffing and patching arbitrary vectors. The diff is computed by [Wagner-Fischer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm).
