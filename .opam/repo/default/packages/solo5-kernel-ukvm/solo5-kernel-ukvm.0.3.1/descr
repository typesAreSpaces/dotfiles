Solo5 sandboxed execution environment (ukvm target)

Solo5 is a sandboxed execution environment primarily intended for, but not
limited to, running applications built using various unikernels (a.k.a.
library operating systems).

This package provides the Solo5 components needed to build and run MirageOS
unikernels on the "ukvm" target, including the "ukvm" monitor source code, and
"ukvm-configure" script used to specialize the monitor at MirageOS unikernel
build time.

This target is supported on 64-bit Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems with
hardware virtualization.
