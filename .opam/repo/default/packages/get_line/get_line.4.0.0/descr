robustly select lines from file; can replace the head and tail shell commands and do even more

usage:
get_line {--range|-r} {+n|-n|i|i..j|i,j[,...]} [-i FILE] [--rand] [-v] (1 <= i [<= j] <= N; N = nb. lines in FILE)

  -v invert the selection of lines (like 'grep -v')
  --rand randomize selected lines before writing them out
  -i <filename> where to read lines from (default=stdin)
  -o <filename> where to write lines to (default=stdout)
  {-r|--range} {+n|-n|i|i..j|i,j[,...]}: line selection policy;
               (+n => top n lines;
                -n => last n lines;
                n => only line n;
                i..j => lines i to j;
                i,j[,...] => only lines i,j,...
