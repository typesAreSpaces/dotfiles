Address Resolution Protocol purely in OCaml


ARP is an implementation of the address resolution protocol purely in OCaml.  It
handles IPv4 protocol addresses and Ethernet hardware addresses only.

A MirageOS [V1_LWT.ARP](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/blob/v2.9.0/types/V1.mli#L471) implementation is in the mirage subdirectory.

Motivation for this implementation is [written up](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/ARP).
