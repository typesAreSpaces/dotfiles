The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG and PPM

The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG and PPM in
OCaml, relying on only one external dependency: 'decompress'.

Supported image formats:
 - PNG (full implementation of RFC 2083),
 - PPM, PGM, PBM, ... (fully supported),
 - JPG (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - GIF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - XCF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - Other formats rely on 'convert' (imagemagick).

As imagelib only requires 'decompress', it can be used together with
js_of_ocaml to compile projects to Javascript. Note that some of the
features of imagelib require the convert binary  (and thus cannot be
used from Javascript).
