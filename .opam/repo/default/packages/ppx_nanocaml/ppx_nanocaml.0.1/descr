Framework for writing nanopass-style compilers

A PPX-based toolkit that eases compiler writing
by automatically generating the code needed to
write a compiler. Nanocaml is designed for the
nanopass-style of writing compilers, which
emphasizes the use of many small passes that
only perform one change to the AST, rather than
only a few large passes.
