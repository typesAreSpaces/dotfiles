Include a file as a string at compile time

ppx_blob allows you to include a binary blob from a file as a string. Writing `[%blob "filename"]` will replace the string with the contents of the file at compile time. This allows the inclusion of arbitary, possibly compressed, data, without the need to respect OCaml's lexical conventions.
