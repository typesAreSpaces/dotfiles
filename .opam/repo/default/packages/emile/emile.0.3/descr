Emile is a library to parse an e-mail address in OCaml. This project is an
extraction of [MrMime](https://github.com/oklm-wsh/MrMime.git) - but we use
[Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom.git) instead an internal
decoder.

This implementation follow some RFCs:
- RFC 822
- RFC 2822
- RFC 5321 (domain part)
- RFC 5322
- RFC 6532

We handle UTF-8 (RFC 6532), domain defined on the SMTP protocol (RFC 5321), and
general e-mail address purpose (RFC 822, RFC 2822, RFC 5322) including
_folding-whitespace_.

The last means we can parse something like:

```
A Group(Some people)
   :Chris Jones <c@(Chris's host.)public.example>,
     joe@example.org,
 John <jdoe@one.test> (my dear friend); (the end of the group)"
```

For a general purpose, it's not needed and is close e-mail purpose.

Then, for domain part (explained on RFC 6532 - SMTP protocol), we handle this
kind of domain:

```
first.last@[12.34.56.78]
first.last@[IPv6:1111:2222:3333::4444:12.34.56.78]
```

The parser of IPv* is done by [Ipaddr](https://github.com/mirage/ipaddr.git).
As a old specification, we handle multiple-domains like:
 
```
<@a.com,b.com:john@doe.com>
```

Obviously, we handle (nested) comments:

```
a(a(b(c)d(e(f))g)h(i)j)@iana.org
```

All parsers are binded with a comment which explain where you can find the ABNF
description and some notes about implementation. All was check by hand.
