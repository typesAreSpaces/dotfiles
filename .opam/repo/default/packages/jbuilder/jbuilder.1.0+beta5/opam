# descr: "
# Fast, portable and opinionated build system
#
# jbuilder is a build system that was designed to simplify the release
# of Jane Street packages. It reads metadata from \"jbuild\" files
# following a very simple s-expression syntax.
#
# jbuilder is fast, it has very low-overhead and support parallel builds
# on all platforms. It has no system dependencies, all you need to build
# jbuilder and packages using jbuilder is OCaml. You don't need or make
# or bash as long as the packages themselves don't use bash explicitely.
#
# jbuilder supports multi-package development by simply dropping multiple
# repositories into the same directory.
#
# It also supports multi-context builds, such as building against
# several opam roots/switches simultaneously. This helps maintaining
# packages across several versions of OCaml and gives cross-compilation
# for free.
