Earley parser combinator library

Earley is a parser combinator library base on Earley's algorithm. It
is intended to be used in conjunction with Earley-OCaml, which is an
extensible parser for OCaml (distributed separately).  It contains a
syntax extension for OCaml,  which allows the definition of  parsers
inside the language.
