Coclobas is a scheduler for HPC-like jobs accessible through HTTP

It can be setup with three configurations:

- Using Kubernetes and the *Google Container Engine*,
  i.e. using a Kubernetes “eleastic” cluster setup with `gcloud` and submitting
  jobs as Kubernetes “pods”.
- Using the server's machine as a one-node cluster and submitting jobs as docker
  containers given a maximal number of jobs.
- Using AWS-Batch, submitting jobs with aws-cli and optionally using
  S3 bucket to share data (new in 0.0.2, and a bit experimental).

Coclobas is mostly used as a Ketrew plugin, but can be driven separately.
