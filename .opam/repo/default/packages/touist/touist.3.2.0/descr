The solver for the Touist language

The Touist language is a friendly language for writing propositional
logic, logic on real and integers (SMT) and quantified boolean
formulas (QBF). This language aims to formalize real-life problems
(e.g., the sudoku can be solved in a few lines). Touist embeds the
minisat solver (for propositional logic) and the yices2 solver
(optional, for SMT logic). It can also generate the DIMACS, SMT2 and
latex formats from you touist file.

Optionnal solvers:
- for using the embeded SMT solver, run `opam install yices2` and then do
  `opam reinstall touist`
- for using the embeded QBF solver, run `opam install qbf` and then do
  `opam reinstall touist`
