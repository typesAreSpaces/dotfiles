A sound analysis that will remove all unused code.

An pass that conservatively removes dead code. The removed dead code
is usually produced by a lifter, though it might be possible that a
binary indeed contains a dead code. The algorithm doesn't remove
variables that are stored in memory, only registers are considered.
