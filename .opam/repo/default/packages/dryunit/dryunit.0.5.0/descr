A detection tool for traditional and popular testing frameworks

It works with Alcotest or OUnit 2. It's fast. Everything processed
(with the help of OCaml's parser) is cached - *you can choose where*.
It's intuitive. You can get started with the command line
(be that with templates or `--help`).

No bootstrapping is required and you can keep all your tooling when
writing tests. No compromises on the syntax. *It's as clean as it gets*. You can
see the generated tests running `dryunit gen --framework alcotest` from the
test dir.

If you use jbuilder just run:

```sh
# Setting up a virtual test executable
mkdir tests
dryunit init > tests/jbuild

# Adding a test
echo "let test_dummy () = ()" > tests/dummy_tests.ml

# Running things
jbuilder build tests/main.exe && _build/default/tests/main.exe
```

Integration with other building systems should be straightfoward.
