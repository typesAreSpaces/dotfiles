A detection tool for traditional unit testing in OCaml

Dryunit is a generates bootstrap code for test frameworks. As a result, you get to use plain old OCaml.
For more information, checkout the [repository](https://github.com/gersonmoraes/dryunit).


## Installation

```
opam install dryunit
```

## Conventions

- Test files should either be called `tests.ml`  or `something_tests.ml`
- Test functions should called `test_something`
- By default, test executables are named `main`


## Usage

If you use jbuilder, you can get started using this:

```sh
mkdir tests
dryunit init > tests/jbuild
```

You can also define the framework explicitly using `dryunit init alcotest`. Adding a sample test:

```sh
echo "let test_error () = raise Not_found" > tests/something_tests.ml
jbuilder build tests/main.exe && _build/default/tests/main.exe
```
