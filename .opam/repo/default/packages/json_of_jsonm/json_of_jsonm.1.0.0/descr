json_of_jsonm_lib is a JSON encoder and decoder library that converts text to and from a
`json` type. The library has the following features:

* Uses jsonm to do the actual stream encoding and decoding
* The `json` type is compatible with and a subset of yojson's `json` type
* Provides both string and channel interfaces by default
* The Json_string module provides a standard type `t` interface in addition to the
  `json` type
* Both `result` and exception functions are provided in most cases
* The Json_encoder_decoder functor allows additional IO mechanisms, including Async,
  to be defined easily.
