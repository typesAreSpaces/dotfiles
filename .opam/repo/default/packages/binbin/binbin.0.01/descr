Convenient and human-readable bitmap manipulation.

BinBin is useful to manipulate binary strings (or bitmaps) in a convenient and human-readable format.

It's perfect for testing or otherwise exploratory work (on applied cryptography for example).

If you need an optimized library for production use and resource intensive tasks, other packages would be better fit.
