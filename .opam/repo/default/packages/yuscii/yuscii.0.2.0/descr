[Yuscii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUSCII)
----------------------------------------------

Yuscii is a little library to decode an UTF-7 ([RFC
2152](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2152) for instance) input flow to Unicode.
This library does not implement an encoder because, Eh guy, we are in 2018...

Then, it provides a non-blocking decoder to translate UTF-7 codepoint to UTF-8
codepoint.
